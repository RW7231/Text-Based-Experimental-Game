Text-Based Experimental Game
Author: Robert Walsh

A simple text based game I have been incrementally working on over the past year or so. I have just recently begun this new Java version

Current Status:
  - Game Boots, saves, and loads player stats from a file
  - Combat in early stages, player and foes can fight it out. Players get souls for winning to level up
